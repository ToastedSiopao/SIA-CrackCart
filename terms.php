                <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
                <p>By creating an account and using the CrackCart services, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions.</p>

                <h4>1. User Accounts</h4>

                <h4>3. Prohibited Conduct</h4>
                <p>You agree not to use our services for any unlawful purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction.</p>

                <h4>4. Changes to Terms</h4>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new terms on this page. Your continued use of the service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>
